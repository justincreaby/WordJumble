Built Robotics: Software Engineering Challenge
==============================================
Run It
-----------

Run the code:

    python3 jumble_solver.py corncob_lowercase.txt word

Run the unit test:

    python3 jumble_solver_test.py

Challenge prompt
----------------
Can you build a jumble solver in Python 3?

Example
-------
    $ python3 jumble_solver.py word_list.txt dog
    god
    go
    do

Reference
---------
- About jumble: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumble
- Example word list: http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt

Deliverables
------------
- A working Python program (can share via gist)
- A link to the word list (if different from example)
- Clean, legible code (refer to PEP8 and the Google Python Style Guide)
- Bonus points for mypy type annotations
- Sufficient documentation, including a complexity analysis of your algorithm

Finally, feel free to Google around a bit to understand the problem, but of course make sure the
work is your own :)
